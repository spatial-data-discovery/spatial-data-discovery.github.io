### Sample script:

[sentiment analysis (.py)](scripts/sentiment_analysis.py)

This script takes .csv files with text data and analyzes the text in each row.
It assigns two sentiment scores, assessing subjectivity and polarity.
The sentiment scores are added to the .csv as a new column,
then the .csv with sentiment scores is exported as a new file.
