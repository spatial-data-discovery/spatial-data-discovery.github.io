### **Bio**
   Hi everyone, my name is Ryan Han and I am a senior at the College
    pursuing a Data Science major and a Math minor.

### My Script
[first_word_counter(.py)](scripts/first_word_counter.py)

This script asks for a .txt/.md file and word of your choice and figures out how many times the specific word starts a sentence in the file.

```{python "first", eval = FALSE}
# first_word_counter.py

# By: Ryan Han

# VERSION 1.0

# Last Edit: 2020-02-10

# This script takes .txt or .md files and a word of your choice and returns
# each sentence/sentences where the specified word is the first word. The code
# also prints out the number of times the 'word' appears as the first word.

def first_word_counter():
    # Asking user for file name and word
    file_name = input("Enter file name: ")
    word = input("Enter a word you would like to count in the file: ")

    if len(file_name) < 1 : file_name = "mbox-short.txt"
