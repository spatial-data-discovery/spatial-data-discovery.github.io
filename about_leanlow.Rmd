###Bio
I am part of the Class of 2020! I am from northern Virginia and majoring in CAMS (computational applied math & statistics) and minoring in Computer Science. Hopefully working in Data Science in the future!


###About Me (TMI): 
- I love eating and going out to new restaurants (but I'm a terrible cook).
    
- My favorite movies are **Parasite** (Picture of the year! Let's go!), HER, and Rush Hour.
    
- I am trying to teach myself the guitar but don't know anything about music theory (also trying to learn that)
