### Bio:
I am a senior majoring in *Data Science and Government*.  
Hopefully, I get to combine my passions for geospatial data and helping others in my future career.  
I was born and raised in *Fairfax, VA*.  
I got to spend the spring 2020 semester studying in Madrid, and I hope to get the chance to work abroad at some point in my life.  


### Things I Like:
- Collecting post cards
- Using my espresso machine to make fun coffee drinks 
- Trying new recipes



### Sample Script
[grade_calculator (.py)](scripts/grade_calculator.py)

This script takes each grade from the Spatial Data Discovery course as a user input and outputs a final percentage and letter grade.

``` {python slots, eval=FALSE}


#Calculate Course grade
#Hannah Slevin
#
#grade_calculator.py
#
#VERSION 1.0
#
#LAST EDIT: 2020-09-03
#
#This code requires users to input their percentage grade for each of the graded course assingments without the percentage sign.
#The program will collect each percentage grade and turn them into points that sum up to 100 and output a final percentage and letter grade for the course.
