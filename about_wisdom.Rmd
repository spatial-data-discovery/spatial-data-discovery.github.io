My name is David and I like to sail. I worked at a sailing school teaching dinghy sailing for a few years (*see below for a picture*).

I taught kids to sail several different boats while I was a sailing instructor.

**Bug**
:    An 8ft monohull with one tiny sail

**Hunter 140**
:    A 14ft monohull with two tiny sails

**Laser/RS Neo**
:    An 11ft monohull with one normal-sized sail

**Hobie Wave**
:    A 13ft catamaran with one normal-sized sail

**Hobie Getaway**
:    A 17ft catamaran with two normal-sized sails  

I also enjoy other activities:

* Cooking
* Hiking and backpacking
* Reading fiction and poetry
