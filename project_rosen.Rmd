title: Climate Change and Conflict in Africa

# insert video here -- will be a chunky vertical situation and therefore p ugly

## Overview
Many studies of Africa have linked climate change and conflict.
Climate change can lead to increased conflict through a variety of ways.
As weather becomes less predictable, farmers become less and less successful.
Shortages of food and erratic rainfall patterns drive competition between groups that can spill into violence.

Scarcity often prompts migration and dissatisfaction with the political status quota.
Migration to urban centers or areas with more bountiful food and water creates cultural conflict and intensifies competition for resources.
Populist politicians can also ride the wave of dissatisfaction and exploit insecurity to win votes by worsening ethnic cleavages, reallocating resources from one ethnic group to another, or painting a minority as a scapegoat.

The brunt of climate change is expected to fall on equatorial countries, like those in Africa.
Coastal areas are at risk of going underwater in the coming decades, while inland states risk severe droughts.
Violence and political instability have long plagued Africa.
However, the effects of climate change will worsen matters.

Although intuitive, the strength of the relationship between climate change and conflict is hotly debated amongst academics.
A key study by Hendrix and Saleyhan linked rainfall variability with social conflict,[^hendrix] while 2013 synthesis of the literature on climate and conflict found that more extreme rainfall and warmer temperatures increase the likelihood of conflict.[^hsiang]
Unusual warm temperatures are more often linked with conflict than rainfall variation.[^olo]
The effects of climate change are usually captured with econometric models, not mapped, possibly because the effects, although statistically significant, can be quite small.
In the interest of providing readers with an interesting visualization, the relationship between temperature anomalies and conflict is presented above.

## Data Description
The visualization above uses historical temperature data from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU), as well as conflict data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP).
The CRU TS v4.03 dataset contains monthly air temperature data, georeferenced to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees and measured in degrees Celsius.[^cru]
The CRU website allows the public to download one-decade global datasets.
The UCDP dataset contains global, georeferenced conflict fatalities data from 1989 to 2010. [^ucdp]

A Python script was used to process global monthly data from 1960 to 2010.[^python]
The script compiled five decade-long datasets into a single NetCDF file and subsetted the dataset to only include a rectangle that spanned the African continent.[^nc]
Then, the script calculated a cell-by-cell 50-year average temperature for the dataset.
The final data product is a raster of Africa from 1989 to 2010, where each 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree cell represents the difference, in degrees Celsius, between the year's arithmetic mean temperature for the cell and the 50-year average.

After adding all of the temperature and conflict data to QGIS,[^qgis] I added a map of African state boundaries,[^boundaries] then used it to limit conflict data to only events inside of Africa.
Inside of QGIS, each year of conflict and temperature anomaly data was mapped using the same scale, legend, and extent settings.
Then, the yearly visualizations were exported as PNG files.[^png]
When all 31 PNG files were complete, they were uploaded to GIMP,[^gimp] optimized, and exported as a GIF.[^gif]
Finally, the GIF was converted into a video using... (not done with this part of the process?)
