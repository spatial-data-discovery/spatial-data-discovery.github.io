Bio
:  I'm a junior majoring in Data Science, and I can do a flip.

Things I am *scared* of
:   - E.T.
    - Spiders
    - the show Wallace and Gromit
    - deer
    - 3 lane highways

### Sample script
[Slot Machine (.py)][scripts/slot_machine.py]
My sample script is something I used for a lab in my Machine Learning class last semester.
It uses a slot machine simulator as an example for Upper Confidence Bound reinforcment learning.
This type of machine learning can be used to help other problems such as identifying the best treatment in clinical testing
and looking at best performance in online advertising or in game designing.

#This script shows how Upper Confidence Boundary reinforcment learning
#is used with machine slots as an example, and prompts the user for the starting balance and trial number.
