####Sample Script

This is a script that takes a netCDF file which contains data for a variable(usually climate), latitude,
longitude and time. It averages the file across the climate variable and writes it out to a new netCDF file.

To run this script, place a netCDF file in the same folder as the script and run with the command

```
python netcdf_mean.py YourFile.nc

```

```
