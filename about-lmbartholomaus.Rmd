This is from a modeling gig I had over the summer

# Sample Script
below is a python script that will determine the duplicate files in a given folder

```python

import os
import sys
import hashlib

#find duplicates of files in parentFolder
def findDuplicate(parentFolder):
    # duplicates in format {hash:[names]}
    duplicates = {}
    for dirName, subdirs, filelist in os.walk(parentFolder):
        print('Scanning %s...' % dirName)
        for filename in filelist:
            path = os.path.join(dirName, filename)
            file_hash = hashfile(path)
            if file_hash in duplicates:
                duplicates[file_hash].append(path)
            else:
                duplicates[file_hash] = [path]
    return duplicates

# join two dictionaries
def joinDictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    for key in dict2.keys():
        if key in dict1:
            dict1[key] = dict1[key] + dict2[key]
        else:
            dict1[key] = dict2[key]

# calculate hash of given file
def hashfile(path, blocksize = 65536):
    afile = open(path, 'rb')
    hasher = hashlib.md5()
    buf = afile.read(blocksize)
    while len(buf)>0:
        hasher.update(buf)
        buf = afile.read(blocksize)
    afile.close()
    return hasher.hexdigest()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        duplicates = {}
        folders = sys.argv[1:]
        for i in folders:
            if os.path.exists(i):
                joinDictionaries(duplicates, findDuplicate(i))
            else:
                print('%s is not a valid path')
                sys.exit()
        print(duplicates)
    else:
        print('Terminal Input: python duplicateFinder.py folder or python duplicateFinder.py folder1 folder2 folder3')
        
 ```
