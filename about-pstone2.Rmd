**About me**

My name is Patrick Stone.
I am a sophomore data science major.
I am excited to learn about spatial data.
I have some experience with spatial data from my senior research project in high school but I am hoping to learn a lot this semester!
In my free time, I mainly enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons.
I hope to graduate and specialize in machine learning. 

**Top D&D spells**

1. Fireball
2. Disintegrate
3. Finger of death
