**About me**

My name is Patrick Stone.
I am a sophomore data science major.
I am excited to learn about spatial data.
I have some experience with spatial data from my senior research project in high school but I am hoping to learn a lot this semester!
In my free time, I mainly enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons.
I hope to graduate and specialize in machine learning. 

**Top D&D spells**

1. Fireball
2. Disintegrate
3. Finger of death

```python
#import the the library we need
from mpmath import mp

#define the function
def pi_digets(x):
  mp.dps = x+1 #make it so that it will give you the number of decimal places you imput
  if str(x).isnumeric() == True: #check to see if you made a valid imput 
    return print(mp.pi) #print the correct value
  else:#if invalid 
    return print('You did not imput an int for x')
```
