## Overview
Health care in the United States isn't bad; on the contrary, it's quite good.
We have access to technology and medicine that assists with a range of
illnesses and disabilities and we are always making advances in healthcare.
However, our system is biased and that significantly impacts the  accessibility
of care to those in need. This map is a basic exploration into the number of
children's hospitals per state. It shows the number per state, with Texas and
California having the most hospitals, while many states have no hospital. Some
states have many children's hospitals, others have none, creating disadvantaged
populations in those states in particular.

In states where there are children's hospitals, they are generally centralized
around one area, which disadvantages patients, particularly in rural areas. The
darkest green areas in the map above show where hospitals are centralized in
each state, while the lighter areas are where there are less hospitals. White
areas indicate the absence of children's hospitals in general.

## Data Description
The data visualized above is from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level
Data (HIFLD)[^hifld] and contains information about children's hospitals in the United States. This data was extracted from a database of general hospital information using the script below. Various state department and federal sources contributed to this general database. This script produced an output CSV file containing only children's hospital information, which was then uploaded and visualized using QGIS[^qgis]. Three D rendering was used to show the number of hospitals per state and a video was taken of the rendering. Ffmpeg[^ffmpeg] was used to crop the video to a size appropriate for the website.
