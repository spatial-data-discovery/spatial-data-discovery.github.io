### Setting Environment Variables
For convenience, I have included a check in my example scripts for an environment variable called "DS_WORKSPACE" that is used for reading from and saving to a designated workspace folder on your computer.
If this variable does not exist, the scripts assume you want to read and write to the working folder (i.e., the same folder that your script lives in).
To create and define your workspace folder, please follow these instructions.

#### On Windows
* On your keyboard, type "Win + s" to open the search bar.
* Type "environ" in the search bar and select "Edit environment variables for your account"
* Under "User variables for 'user'", click "New..."
* For Variable name, type `DS_WORKSPACE`
* For Variable value, type an absolute path to your directory (e.g., "C:\\Workspace"); you may use the "Browse Directory..." button to navigate to your folder of choice.
* Click OK and click OK again.


#### On macOS / Linux
Run the following command in the terminal or save it to your `~/.bash_profile` to run it every time you open a terminal.

* `export DS_WORKSPACE=~/Workspace`


### Hacking ArcGIS Pro's Python
[https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-conda.htm](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-conda.htm)

- Clone ArcGIS Pro python environment and name it (e.g., 'sdd')
- Create user environment that points to `...\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\Scripts\`
- Open terminal, type `activate sdd`


### Converting Images to Animations
Based on Davis's MODIS EVI example using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and FFmpeg (FFmpeg installed with [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)).

1. Load spatial data into QGIS
    - Create symbology (save symbology to text file so you can open it and apply it to all your other layers; saves time selecting color ramps and ranges each time)
    - Create layout (save layout in case you need to come back to it)
    - Add map(s), legend(s), and text to layout
    - Update and export maps to images (PNG) for each visualization
1. Load images into GIMP
    - Open one PNG in GIMP
    - Open as layers the remaining images (order most recent layer at the top)
    - Crop image to selection (use Rectangle Select Tool (shortcut key `r`) to draw a box around what you want, then use Image &#8594; Crop to Selection)
    - Optimize your layers for GIF animation (Filters &#8594; Animation &#8594; Optimize for GIF)
1. Save your layers as an animated GIF (Export &#8594; GIF)
    - Check [x] As animation
    - Loop forever
    - Delay between frames (e.g., 150 ms)
    - Use delay entered above for all frames
1. From the command line, convert exported GIF to video format ([reference](https://gist.github.com/ingramchen/e2af352bf8b40bb88890fba4f47eccd0))

    Update the `-i` input file name and `.mp4` output file name

    ```
    ffmpeg -f gif -i Untitled.gif -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -movflags +faststart -filter:v crop='floor(in_w/2)*2:floor(in_h/2)*2' Untitled.mp4
    ```


### Interpolating
Let's say you are given two pairs of information (\(x_1, y_1\)) and (\(x_2, y_2\)).
These, for example, may represent elevations at two given locations or rainfall values at two given dates.
Regardless of what they represent, let's say you are interested in finding the value \(u\) that lies somewhere between \(y_1\) and \(y_2\), which occurs at a location \(k\) between \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).
In table format, it looks something like this:

| X     | Y     | Description |
|:-----:|:-----:|:------------|
| $x_1$ | $y_1$ | Known $x,y$ pair just below the value you are looking for |
| $k$   | $u$   | The pair you want the $y$-value for |
| $x_2$ | $y_2$ | Known $x,y$ pair just above the value you are looking for |

By linear interpolation, the rule of equal ratios applies, which states the following:

$$\frac{k - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{u - y_1}{y_2 - y_1}$$

and can be solved for the unknown value, \(u\), represented by the following:

$$u = \frac{\left(y_2 - y_1\right) \left(k - x_1\right)}{x_2 - x_1} + y_1$$
