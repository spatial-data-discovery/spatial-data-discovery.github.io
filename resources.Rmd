# Methods

### Linear Interpolation
Let's say you are given two pairs of information (\(x_1, y_1\)) and (\(x_2, y_2\)).
These, for example, may represent elevations at two given locations or rainfall values at two given dates.
Regardless of what they represent, let's say you are interested in finding the value \(u\) that lies somewhere between \(y_1\) and \(y_2\), which occurs at a location \(k\) between \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).
In table format, it looks something like this:

| X     | Y     | Description |
|:-----:|:-----:|:------------|
| $x_1$ | $y_1$ | Known $x,y$ pair just below the value you are looking for |
| $k$   | $u$   | The pair you want the $y$-value for |
| $x_2$ | $y_2$ | Known $x,y$ pair just above the value you are looking for |

By linear interpolation, the rule of equal ratios applies, which states the following:

$$\frac{k - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{u - y_1}{y_2 - y_1}$$

and can be solved for the unknown value, \(u\), represented by the following:

$$u = \frac{\left(y_2 - y_1\right) \left(k - x_1\right)}{x_2 - x_1} + y_1$$
