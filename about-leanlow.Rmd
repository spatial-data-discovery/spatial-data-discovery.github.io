### Bio
I am part of the Class of 2020! I am from northern Virginia and majoring in CAMS (computational applied math & statistics) and minoring in Computer Science. Hopefully working in Data Science in the future!


### About Me (TMI): 
- I love eating and going out to new restaurants (but I'm a terrible cook).
- My favorite movies are **Parasite** (Picture of the year! Let's go!), HER, and Rush Hour.
- I am trying to teach myself the guitar but don't know anything about music theory (also trying to learn that)
    

### Sample script
[Extracting Column from csv Files (.py)](scripts/extract_column.py)

This sample script was originally made to extract gene names from files that contain the gene names, counts, and various statistics. The extracted column is put into a text file and removes the first item which would typically be the word 'gene'. This file is useful for looking comparing genes later on or any header column.

This script can take an argument -c for the column number to be extracted, this index starts at 0 (0 is the first column and so on). The only default argument needed is the file path that is a csv file, it will take the first column on default.

Usage: extract_column.py <file path> -c <column number with index starting at 0>

```{python header_to_textfile, eval=FALSE}    
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
Gets all of the content that is in the first column of a csv
Skips the header to make content more iterable

Usage: Extract_header_column.py <Directory of files>
Output: Text files of the gene names in the same directory

Example output file name:
<Sib_18_30_symmetric_difference_results.csv_names
