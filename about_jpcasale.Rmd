Bio
:   I am from Redmond, WA, and I am a student at the College of William and Mary.  I enjoy many activities, including drawing, singing, games, and weight lifting; I especially enjoy **acting**.  What I do _not_ like?  I'd say jogging, useless Apple products, and hot weather. 

CODING LANGUAGES I'VE WORKED WITH
- Python
- Java
- C and C++
- A tiny bit of Pascal
- A tiny bit of SQL
