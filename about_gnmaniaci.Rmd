Bio: 
     Hi! 
     My name is Gianna, and I am a junior at the college majoring in data science and minoring in public health. 
     I love to travel, one of my goals is to go to all of the national parks in the US. 
     I have currently been to _9 parks_. 
     The last one I went to was the Grand Canyon.
