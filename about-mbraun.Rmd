*About*

I'm interested in scholarly works within reformed theology and I have seriously benefited from reading the works of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Rene Descartes, George Berkeley, among others.
I also love the works of Dr. R.C. Sproul and Adrian Rogers.  My all time favorite book is the Bible, I recommend you give the Gospel of John a try.

Some of my hobbies include learning Koine Greek and playing guitar.  
In my leisure time I enjoy listening to a variety of genres of music and playing first-person shooters.
