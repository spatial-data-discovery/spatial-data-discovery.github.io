Bio
:  Hi! I am a senior majoring in Data Science with a minor in Sociology.

A few of my **favorite** things: 

- frenchies (hence, the image)
- chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream
- plants everywhere in my apartment
- having no readings to do
when im sad... I simply remember my *favorite* things...
