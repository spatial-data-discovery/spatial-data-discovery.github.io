### Bio
I am a senior, double majoring in Data Science and English.

### Some of my hobbies
- Tennis (watching and playing)
- Knitting
- Reading

### Sample Script
[text_preprocessing.py](scripts/text_preprocessing.py)

I made this script to clean text, so it can be used for natural language processing. It can be frustrating to repeat these steps for any NLP task, so this script takes care of that for you by taking a .txt file and performing common preprocessing tasks. It then outputs a new .txt file with the final text after having lowercased; removed numbers, punctuation, and stopwords; and tokenized and lemmatized the text.

# Last Edit: 2021-09-18

# This script performs text preprocessing on a .txt file by removing
# stop words, removing numbers, removing punctuation, lowercasing,
# tokenizing, and lemmatizing. It then returns the preprocessed text
# in a .txt file.

from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Read in the text
text_file = open('example.txt', 'r')

text_file.close()

# Create list of stopwords, combining NLTK's set with user-inputed words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words(language))
extra_stops = extra_stops.translate(extra_stops.maketrans('','',string.punctuation)).lower()
extra_stops = extra_stops.split(' ')
for item in extra_stops:
    stop_words.add(item)

# Remove all numbers from the text
text_no_nums = text.translate(text.maketrans('','',string.digits))

# Lowercase text and remove all punctuation
clean_text = text_no_nums.translate(text_no_nums.maketrans('','',string.punctuation)).lower()

# Tokenize the text
words = word_tokenize(clean_text)

# Remove stopwords
clean_text_no_stops = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]

# Perform lemmatization
final_text = []
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
for word in clean_text_no_stops:
    lemm_word = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)
    final_text += [lemm_word]
