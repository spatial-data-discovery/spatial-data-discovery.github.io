Bio
:   Catholic-to-be, statistician-to-be, gamer, small-time coder.
    In my free time, I like to play video games, though they are addicting. I also enjoy playing the piano (even though I can't play the piano), and over the summer I started coding an application in Python, which will let you manage your portfolio (like for stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets which I haven't implemented yet). Turns out this coding project is quite a bit of work, especially because I want to make it so you it will tell you how much you owe in taxes.... which means I have to understand all those long IRS documents regarding capital gains, dividends, stocks, and I have to assume what taxation is like for crypto because it doesn't entirely exist yet.
