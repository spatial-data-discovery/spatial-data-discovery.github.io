Bio
:   Catholic-to-be, statistician-to-be, gamer, small-time coder.
    In my free time, I like to play video games, though they are addicting. I also enjoy playing the piano (*even though I can't play the piano*), and over the summer I started coding an application in Python, which will let you manage your portfolio (for stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets which I haven't implemented yet). Turns out this coding project is quite a bit of work, especially because I want to make it so you it will tell you how much you owe in taxes.... which means I have to understand all those long IRS documents regarding capital gains, dividends, stocks, and I have to assume what taxation is like for crypto because it doesn't entirely exist yet. I should probably create a github repository for it but I want to learn more about open-source licensing (*like the GPL-3 and MIT licenses*) first.


### Sample script

```#Written for Python 3.9 64-bit

#A simple script which allows the user to discover the nth prime number. (1=2, 2=3, 3=5, 4=7, 5=11, ...)

#I think this could be more efficient using a binary tree to store all the prime numbers in,
#and then you would only check if the current number is divisble by any prime number less than the current number's square root. 
#but I got lazy and didn't feel like implementing a BST, so for now, don't search for prime numbers beyond like 100,000 or else the program take eons to finish computing
#It already takes like, 4 seconds to discover the 30,000th prime number. And that's with an i7-9750H

import time
import math

#Lets user define 'n', the neth prime number to be calculated

    #Prints the results of the calculation. Have to do some malarkey to make sure that the grammar is right for "1st, 21st, 11th, 111th, etc."
