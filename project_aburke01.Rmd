## Overview

Driving on the New Jersey Turnpike, most individuals notice the towering chemical manufacturing plants and dark grey smoke billowing into the air.
What they may not know, is that New Jersey has another serious environmental and health concern---more Superfund Sites on the National Priorities List than any other State.
The National Priorities List (NPL) comes from the CERLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) passed in 1980 under President Jimmy Carter. ("What Is Superfund?," 2018)

Since its passage, countless sites have been proposed and rated on the Hazard Ranking System, with the ultimate goal of being deleted.
The "EPA may delete a final NPL site if it determines that no further response is required to protect human health or the environment.” ("Superfund: National," 2018)
Unfortunately, some sites have been re-added to the list at a later date due to community outcry and the rate of deletion has been seen as in-efficient at best throughout this law’s 40-year history. ("Not so Super," 1994, p. 16)
For example, the "Cornell Dubilier Electronics plant in South Plainfield. The E.P.A., which began work on the site in 1997, said the cleanup would not be completed until 2034." (Holmberg, 2008)

Some of the challenges facing the EPA include the way the law itself is constructed.
One of its original aims was to force the responsible party to be financially liable for the cleanup. ("Superfund: National," 2018)
A fund, paid for by taxes on corporations called the Orphan Fund, would pay for the sites where an owner could not be identified.
However, a significant number of these sites are considered Orphan Sites.
Since 1995 when the Orphan Fund lost its tax funding, the EPA has had to depend on appropriations from Congress to fund these remediations. ("The Return," 2010, p. 18)
This funding is often unpredictable since it is dependent on the leanings of the current administration.
Additionally, some local governments, specifically in the New Jersey area, have stated that remediation efforts by the EPA are not efficient, potentially increase levels of pollution in their air, water and soil, and negatively affect property prices. ("Not so Super," 1994, p. 16).

As you can see in the above visualization, there were 113 active sites in 2019.
A total of 36 have been deleted over 40 years of CERLA being in place, making the rate of deletion for New Jersey about 0.9 sites per year.
Furthermore, of the 113 sites still considered active, 73 have been on the National Priorities List since the 1980s.

Contaminated sites hold real environmental and health consequences for those living near them.
Even though remediation is an extremely time consuming and expensive endeavor, the impacts of toxic waste cannot be ignored or delayed.
The longer the EPA and individual states wait for funding, the longer people are living in unsafe conditions, breathing polluted air and drinking contaminated water.
Without action, the rate of deletion will continue to be low, the National Priorities List will continue to be long and communities will continue to be at risk.


## Data Description

* The original dataset for the above visualization can be found
at https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=33cebcdfdd1b4c3a8b51d416956c41f1

* To access the CSV files, zoom out of the map and click on
the up-arrow at the bottom of the screen and export to CSV.

* Attributes used to separate the CSV files:
- State
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Listing Date: Date that the site was added to the National Priorities List
- Deletion Date: Date that the site was removed from the National Priorities List

* More information about attributes can be
found at https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl
This data was found on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's website.
There is a link to see the full CSV file visualized using ARCGIS.

My script takes the 1,810 total entries and separates New Jersey entries into a file called NJ_SupfundSites.csv.
It then creates eight CSV files based on four time periods:1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009 and 2010-2019.

Each CSV file contains entries that have a Listing Date up to the time frame but don't have a Deletion Date earlier than the time frame.
Thus, the entries in the individual time periods represent the superfund sites that were active
at those times.
The count CSV files contain the sites that were deleted off the list during a given time frame.
This data is used for the counts visible on the PNG files and the visualization.

For each time frame, the CSV files of the Superfund sites were visualized in QGIS[^qgis] and layered over a New Jersey County Boundary shape-file from the NJ Department of GIS website https://gisdata-njdep.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/newjersey::county-boundaries-of-nj.

For each of the four time periods shown on the visualization, the green dots are superfund sites that have been deleted from the National Priorities List, while the red dots are active sites.
Each of the maps created for the time periods were then exported to PNG files from QGIS[^qgis], resized using GIMP[^gimp], and uploaded onto GIPHY[^giphy].
The GIF file was then exported as a video encoded in MPEG-4[^mpeg4] and downloaded.
