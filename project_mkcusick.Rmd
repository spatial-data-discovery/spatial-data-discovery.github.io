## Overview
This project visualizes the spread of COVID-19 within the contiguous United States. The animation begins on 1/21/2020 and updates weekly through 4/21/20.

This is achieved by representing every county as an individual polygon, and coloring them by the 'cases' attribute column. Invisible counties have no recorded COVID-19 cases, beige counties have <= 100 cases, increasing up to the maximum recorded amount of ~5400 cases. See the visualization section for details on the tools used.

COVID-19 is a threat to humanity, and it is therefore important to track it with the goal of developing methods to prevent further spread. By monitoring the spread of COVID-19 on a county by county level, scientists can determine the effectiveness of local quarantine and social distancing methods.

## Data Description
The data for this visualization comes from a [NY Times COVID-19 dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv) and a [NY Times US County dataset](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=53935d5d1c8540539d290072fcda77c1).

The NY Times COVID-19 dataset is updated daily. Running my script will use urllib.request[^urllib] to download the latest csv and then perform minor modifications
to a few fips values so every county can be represented in the visualization.

These two datasets can be merged together in ArcGIS Pro via their shared FIPS values, resulting in the table used for the visualization.

This script is written in Python[^python].

```

NYTConvid19USCountyDataURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv"

# This dataset is NOT needed for the script, but is needed to create the visualization       
# Save the dataset in the geodatabase, you will use this database
# for the 'outGDB' variable

```
## Visualization
Visualization created in ArcGIS Pro using the Timeslider[^timeslider] and Animation[^animation] tools. The merged dataset has a date-time attribute, which allows ArcGIS Pro to show changes in the data over time. These views are added as keyframes into the animation tool, and finally exported into a mp4 file.

Many thanks to Tanu Hoque[^Tanu], a product engineer on the Esri Mapping Team, for providing the NY Times County dataset and insight on how to
get the COVID-19 data from github using a script.
