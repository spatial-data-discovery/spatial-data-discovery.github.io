Bio
:   I am a senior CAMS major hoping to pursue a career in data analysis. I was born in San Diego CA, but grew up in Prague CZ.


*Some of my hobbies*
:   - Basketball
    - Video games
    - Listening to music


### Sample Script
[Statistical Overview (.py)](scripts/statistical_overview.py)

My utility script is a simple program that reads in numerical data from a text file and provides a brief statistical overview. This includes the mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the data.  

```{python musicman, eval=FALSE}
