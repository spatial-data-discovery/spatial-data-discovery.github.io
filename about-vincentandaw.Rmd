*Bio*
: My name is Vince, a Senior in the College of William and Mary studying Economics and Data Science

*Things I enjoy doing*
  - volleyball: right back, DS, libero
  - chess: I play online (lichess.org), participated in two US Opens just for fun
  - backpacks: unsure how I got into it, but I like backpacks. I sink a lot of hours watching and reading reviews of cool backpacks.
  - travel: traveled extensively in every continent except Africa, and dreaming of the day I can go there as well as to Antarctica. Synergizing with my backpack hobby, I travel with only one carryon backpack!
  - coding: similar to how one can "enjoy" exercise - it hurts in the moment, and you wonder why you do it, but give it a couple days' time, and you realize the experience was fun (sorta)!
###SAMPLE SCRIPT###
#This script scrapes a webpage reviewing a backpack called the Duo Totepack. 
#It takes all the text, cleans it, and puts it into a txt file for an enjoyable read.

import urllib.request, json, re #re needed to replace whitespace down the line
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url = "https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/bellroy/duo-totepack/" #website to scrape
with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as req:
    contents = req.read() #this will be all the text
soup = BeautifulSoup(contents,'lxml') #lxml parser will be used
text = soup.find_all(['p','h2']) #I want all text in paragraphs (p) and headings (h2)
review = []
for i in text:
    if i.name == 'h2': #I want a colon after every heading to make sentences clearer.
        review.append(i.get_text(strip=True)+':') #get_text() gives a str, which allows concat with ":"
    else:
        review.append(i.get_text(strip=True)) #if not h2, do nothing
review_cleaned = [re.sub("\s+"," ",rev) for rev in review] #changes all whitespace to single space
review_cleaned = review_cleaned[:-5] #the last elements are not important: "thanks for reading" etc
review_txt = " ".join(review_cleaned) #make list into one long str to be written in 
with open('Tandaw_Scraper_Output.txt','w',encoding='UTF-8') as output:
    output.write(review_txt) #write the long str into a txt
