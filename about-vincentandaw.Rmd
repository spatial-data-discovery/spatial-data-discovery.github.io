*Bio*
: My name is Vince, a Senior in the College of William and Mary studying Economics and Data Science

*Things I enjoy doing*
: - volleyball: right back, DS, libero
  - chess: I play online (lichess.org), participated in two US Opens just for fun
  - backpacks: unsure how I got into it, but I like backpacks. I sink a lot of hours watching and reading reviews of cool backpacks.
  - travel: traveled extensively in every continent except Africa, and dreaming of the day I can go there as well as to Antarctica.
  Synergizing with my backpack hobby, I travel with only one carryon backpack!
  - coding: similar to how one can "enjoy" exercise - it hurts in the moment, and you wonder why you do it, but give it a couple days' time,
  and you realize the experience was fun (sorta)!!



# SAMPLE SCRIPT:
[parsehtml (.py)](scripts/parsehtml.py)
```
{
	#works with packhacker.com, e.g. https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/heimplanet/neck-pouch-a5/

	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

	def parsehtml(url):
		with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as req:
			contents = req.read() #this will be all the text
		soup = BeautifulSoup(contents, features='html.parser') 
		text = soup.find_all(['p','h2']) #I want all text in paragraphs (p) and headings (h2)
		review = []
		for i in text:
			if i.name == 'h2': #I want a colon after every heading to make sentences clearer.
				review.append(i.get_text(strip=True)+':') #get_text() gives a str, which allows concat with ":"
			else:
				review.append(i.get_text(strip=True)) #if not h2, do nothing
		review_cleaned = [re.sub("\s+"," ",rev) for rev in review] #changes all whitespace to single space
		review_txt = " ".join(review_cleaned) #make list into one long str to be written in
		with open("Output.txt", "w") as txtfile:
			txtfile.write(review_txt)
		return "done"
