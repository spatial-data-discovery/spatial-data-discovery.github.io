*Bio*
: My name is Vince, a Senior in the College of William and Mary studying Economics and Data Science

*Things I enjoy doing*
: - volleyball: right back, DS, libero
  - chess: I play online (lichess.org), participated in two US Opens just for fun
  - backpacks: unsure how I got into it, but I like backpacks. I sink a lot of hours watching and reading reviews of cool backpacks.
  - travel: traveled extensively in every continent except Africa, and dreaming of the day I can go there as well as to Antarctica.
  Synergizing with my backpack hobby, I travel with only one carryon backpack!
  - coding: similar to how one can "enjoy" exercise - it hurts in the moment, and you wonder why you do it, but give it a couple days' time,
  and you realize the experience was fun (sorta)!!
