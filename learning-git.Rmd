The Guiding Question
:   How will we work together this semester?
    A big part of it will be using Git and GitHub.
    As you can see, our [course website](https://spatial-data-discovery.github.io/) is built from source files in our [Organization Repository](https://github.com/spatial-data-discovery/spatial-data-discovery.github.io) where you will be contributing to its content once you have created a GitHub account and have joined our development team.

    The real power of Git is in its version control, so be sure to read about it.
    We will practice getting everything up and running so you can take the first Sandbox Challenge---these are ungraded challenges I pose to you throughout the semester that emphasize learning a new skill that will be useful as you work through the assignments and project in this class.
    You will find the Sandbox Challenges in the current Semester Repository.

Goals and Objectives
:   - Learn the basics of Git and version control.
    - Familiarize yourself with the two repositories that we will be working with this semester and make sure you get clones of both repositories on your computer.
    - Practice using the Command Prompt / Terminal (e.g., cloning a repository to your computer) **AND/OR** practice using GitHub's web interface.
    - Practice the Git workflow.
