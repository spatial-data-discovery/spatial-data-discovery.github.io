> Crop Yields are in hg/ha. The specified crops are groundnuts, wheat, cereals, cassava, millet, and maize.

## Overview
Agriculture and its transformation plays a role in the economy and development process of countries and can affect the general wellbeing and poverty level of individuals within those countries.[^agricultureinfo] The types and amount of crops grown can also be used to infer information about that countries development, wellbeing, and even predict how it will continue to grow due to agriculture having high correlation with other variables.

Crop Yields represent the harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products and are typically recorded in hectogramme (100 grammes) per hectare (HG/HA).[^cropyields] Crop yields typically increase with the use of better tools and methods of farming along with improved crop varieties. These larger crop yields translate into the farmers being able to sell more surplus crops and thus boosting the economy and supporting more development. However, crop yields also are affected by the weather and climate they are growing in these factors have been changing due to climate change and global warming. As such the agricultural sector has to moderate the impacts of climate change while producing their crops. "A number of studies anticipate a reduction of the crop yield of the main staple food crops in the region in the coming decades due to global warming."[^cropproduction]

As agriculture and crop yields can help with the understanding and prediction of a variety of factors, it is helpful to see how crop yields have changed over time to see if general patterns exist. I decided to create an animation showing the changes in crop yields across different countries in Africa where a lot of developement has been happening between the years of 1961 and 2018. This animation can help with general understandings of certain trends and can be referenced when trying to study specific cases of growth. To also give a basic start to looking at how climate change has potentially impacted countries I included precipitation data for approximately every 5 years for those same countries in Africa.
