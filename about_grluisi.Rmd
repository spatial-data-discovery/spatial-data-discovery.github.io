Bio
:   My name is Grant and I am a junior at the College of William and Mary.
    I am majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (CAMS) with a minor in Classical Studies.

About me:
:   - I am studying to be a pilot.
      I fly Cessna 172's (*see above*)
    - I love hiking and skiing

### Script
[crosswind (.py)](scripts/crosswind.py)

I wrote my sample script to help with initial decision making when I am flying.  
Every runway is denoted by the direction it is pointing to divided by 10.
For example taking off runway 9 would indicate we are traveling to the east (90 degrees).
Every runway has an alternate runway offset by 180 degrees, so the same strip of pavement serves as runway 9 and 27.

It is also important to take wind direction and speed into account.
An aircraft should always be taking off into the wind, and never with a tailwind.
The crosswind component is an important piece of information when determining if it is safe to takeoff or land on a particular runway.

# This script calculates which runway should be used based

    try:

        first_runway = r
        if first_runway <= 18:
            second_runway = r+18
        else:
            second_runway = r-18
        # determining the desired runway
        first_runway = first_runway*10
        second_runway = second_runway*10
        first_runway_degree_crosswind = abs(d-first_runway)

            desired_runway = second_runway
        else:
            desired_runway = first_runway
        # Calculating crosswind component if intial runway is preferred
        if desired_runway == first_runway:

            print('Instead of your intial runway, use runway '+str(second_runway/10)+'. The crosswind_component is '+str(crosswind_component))
    except ValueError:
        print('Oops')

    p = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Calculates which runway to use and the associated crosswind component")
    args = p.parse_args()
