## Overview
The United States has more fast food restaurants than anywhere else in the world.
In fact according to some predictions, there may be as many as 250,000 fast food restaurants in the United States.
No matter what type of food you want to eat there is a fast food version available.
While fast food is tasty, cheap, and convenient it is obviously not the healthiest.

The United states also has a global reputation for being one of the most obese countries in the world.
Unfortunately this is well deserved with over 36% of the population being considered obese and another 33% of the population being overweight.
Naturally many people tend to believe the amount of fast food restaurants tends to have a direct correlation with obesity in the United States.
