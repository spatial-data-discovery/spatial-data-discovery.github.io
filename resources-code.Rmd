### Code Snippets
The following code snippets provide quick tutorials on specific tools, datasets, or concepts.
The snippets are written in Python using a Jupyter Notebook hosted on a cloud environment provided by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
A Google account is required to connect and run these snippets.


[Esri Shapefile](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cpGqlV0KQlqRO6MugpJKc9xsycZ9Iqyb?usp=sharing)
:   Shapefiles are a ubiquitous data format for storing vector (point, line and polygon) data.
    This tutorial shows you how to extract data from a shapefile and save it in GeoJSON format.

[GeoTiff](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JjcfIEMJzl90cD49REsHELyUzXgSeJ8d?usp=sharing)
:   GeoTIFF is based on TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) and is used as an interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery.
    The GeoTIFF file format is in widespread use worldwide and there is strong software support in both the open source and commercial GIS and spatial data analysis software products.
    This tutorial shows you how to read GeoTIFF raster files using both `gdal` and `rasterio` Python packages.

[Regex](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BkAjz5rR-KTMDvjahNtksdqZxODKCSi7?usp=sharing)
:   Regex, or regular expressions, are algorithms that utilize a special syntax to characterize patterns within plain text.
    When it comes to web scraping, regex is one of the best tools in a data scientist's toolbelt.
    This tutorial shows you some examples of regular expressions from scrubbed Wikipedia pages using the `re` Python package.
