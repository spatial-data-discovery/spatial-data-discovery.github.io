## Overview
Amazon is ambitious in taking further control of its supply chain. Since the company launched its first facility for last-mile delivery in 2013, the distribution network has been booming behind services like Prime Now, Whole Foods grocery delivery, and the one-day Prime delivery in plan.

As an e-commerce giant that shared 49% of the market in 2018, Amazon's expansion on distribution network has a wide influence on delivery firms and other local or online retailers. For example, the network has covered most of the densely populated areas till 2019, leaving delivery firms with less profitable rural areas. The population coverage of Amazon's distribution network may offer some insights for business owners and economics researchers to study the local economies and the e-commerce market.

## Data Description
The animation above visualizes the expansion of 1-hour trucking-time areas around Amazon delivery stations in the contiguous U.S. from 2013 to 2020 (projected). The population density map is colored with orange for population within the trucking-time areas and the rest is colored with dark blue.

The population density map is the 2010 U.S. Census Grids downloaded from Center for International Earth Science Information Network([CIESIN](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/usgrid-summary-file1-2010)). For square km grids with the numbers of people ranging from 0 to 20, a gradual change in tint is on display, although the population in several grids may exceed 20.

The addresses of the delivery stations are obtained from MWPVL International([MWPVL](http://www.mwpvl.com/html/amazon_com.html)). A script was used to extract the addresses from a PNG file and another script is used to clean and split the data by year. Both scripts are written in Python. The addresses are geocoded into location points with ArcMap[^arcmap]. Based on these location points, ArcGIS Online is used to estimated the 1-hour trucking-time areas and the estimations are exported as shape files back into ArcMap for clipping. The clipped raster files are later imported into QGIS[^qgis] for scaling and coloring. The output image sequences are made into an animation using Photoshop[^ps].
